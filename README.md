With the sophisticated technological advancement nowadays robotics has become a hot field for research. Robots are now used by military forces for reducing risk of their causalities and to defeat their enemies. The major focus of this project is on the use of robot in war, peace and as well as their impact on society. Here Radio Frequency modules signals are used in wireless remote-control system for transmitting and receiving wireless logic signals to control the motors and actuators of robot control system. Vision monitoring system has been added which will capture and transmit the information surrounding the robot to the operator. With this feature the robot can not only transmit real time videos with vision capabilities but cannot also be identified by the enemies in war zone. A metal detector and flame sensor has also been added which will inform us about any bomb underneath the robot vehicle. In this paper, Remote operated Warfield assistive robot is a small robot designed for assistance, sort range surveillance and inspection purpose.
